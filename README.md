# crackmite
Crackmite Discord bot.

This bot is a joke. It's currently being used on a private Discord server, purely for experimenting with the Discord.JS libary.

It has the minimal amount of commands available, those being the built-in [Discord.JS Commando](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando) commands. This may or may not be subject of change.

If you *do* chose to run this locally for some odd reason, then here's how:

1. Install all dependencies with `npm i` or `npm install`
2. Run the main bot file with `node server.js`
